    "text": "Thank You Professor Margaret Robinson\n\n\"The best thing for being sad,\" said Merlin, \"is to learn something.\"\nIt's a quote you've shared with us before, and one that feels especially fitting now. Throughout your years at Mount Holyoke, you've lived those words, teaching with brilliance, compassion, and an unwavering belief in your students.\nHaving taught nearly every math course at Mount Holyoke, you've touched countless lives across generations of students. You've been more than a teacher, you've been a mentor, a steadfast advocate, and a constant source of warmth and wisdom. You believed in us before we believed in ourselves.\nThank you for everything you have done for us and Mount Holyoke. As you step into this new chapter, we wanted to share a few messages from those lucky enough to learn from you. Each one carries our deepest gratitude, admiration, and love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, Thank you for everything! Your enthusiasm as a teacher is infectious. Your natural curiousity and kindness made you so approachable and such a good mentor. Your amazing memory of prior students and desire to help others were invaluable as a networking resource for students and alums. I will miss seeing you on campus, but I know you will make the most of your time to meet new challenges and learn new things! I hope you have a wonderful retirement, filled with lots of time with family, new projects, and joy. Love, Mary Fleischli\n\n\n\n\nYour love of math is infectious. I am deeply grateful for how much you care about your students and how dedicated you are to being an impactful teacher.\n\n\n\n\nThank you for everything you’ve done for us! Your dedication to teaching, research, and mentorship has made a huge difference for me and many other students at Mount Holyoke College. I still remember your smiles when I first met you under the camp during orientation. I feel so lucky to have met you and to be able to attend your class. Your passion to maths inspires me and motivates me a lot 💓\n\n\n\n\nI'm an advisee of Professor Robinson from the Class of 2024. She has had a profound impact on both my academic journey and my personal life. Under her guidance, I was first introduced to the world of Mathematics, and she played a pivotal role in shaping my path. I miss her greatly!\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations on retirement! Thank you so much for sharing your love of math and for all do the guidance, insights, and opportunities your provided. You helped make the Mount Holyoke Math Department a wonderful place to learn. \n-Rae Tomarkin\n\n\n\n\nThank you for your enthusiasm and care! You made a real difference in my life.  Your classes were excellent, ensuring that I was not afraid to take on any math problem. You willingly gave me a recommendation when I came to you 2 years after graduation after having not talked to you in years, which helped me get my Masters and my current career.  Never doubt your amazing impact, and I hope you enjoy every bit of the fun of this next phase in your life.\n\n\n\n\nHi!!!! I came to MHC with an AA, concentration math. I wanted to pursue astrophysics, but signed up for all the higher level math I could find as well. You were an inspiration. You made me feel like a math minor was possible, even with a \"double major\" like astronomy and physics. (I also had a French Minor!) I have memories of your office, chatting like adults. I'm so grateful to you. Especially because the reason I likely got into MHC was a heartfelt recommendation from Ellen Ortyl, who had worked on campus. She had connected me with Laurie Kamins, whose lovely kids I had the pleasure of babysitting for! I'm just very grateful for your existence, and how you welcomed me into the fold as a transfer student from Cape Cod. &lt;3 Happy Retirement!!!!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson, I recently heard the news of your retirement, and I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and share your lasting impact on me, even after 10+ years post graduating Mount Holyoke. \n\nI still remember your classes vividly. Beyond the equations and proofs, you taught me how to approach problems with curiosity and persistence—skills that continue to serve me well in my personal and professional life. Your passion for mathematics and your ability to make complex concepts engaging left a lasting impression on me, and I’m so grateful to have been one of your students. Every time I've had the chance to come back on campus, I make sure to stop by your office on the 4th floor. You've taught and inspired generations of students, and I'm proud to be one of them. \n\nI wish you all the best as you enjoy this well-deserved next phase—whether it’s filled with travel, new hobbies, or just some well-earned rest.\n\nThank you!!\nKleida Martiro\nClass of 2014\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, \n\nI miss you so much and wanted to share a quick update about my life. \nAfter graduating from Isenberg in 2016, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye as I was expecting my first child in May.  In the Fall of 2018, I started teaching at Santa Clara University's Finance department, where I spent four years before joining Meta as a data scientist.  My role involves developing new methodologies to measure top advertisers.  \n\nI'm grateful for your guidance and support throughout my journey.  Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today.  You played a significant role not only as my professor, but also as a mentor and guardian to help guide my paths forward.  I feel so lucky to have been one of your students and advisees.  \n\nSending you love from the sunny Bay Area!  Please visit us whenever you can. Thank you immensely for everything!  Your impact on my life is immeasurable. \n\nWith heartfelt gratitude,\n~Ning Pu (Class of 2007)\nEmail: ningpu62@gmail.com \nPhone: (413) 335-9291\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson, Thank you for inspiring a love for mathematics in us!! -- A proud fellow mathematician named K Kaya\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret,  this is Gina Leung from class of 2012. I was a dance and mathematics major. Thank you for being such an inspiring professor, and also for coming to all my dance concerts! It really meant a lot to me. I am still in the UK. I have 3 (soon to be 4!) sons. You might be interested to know that my eldest son (6) loves math and loves doing math challenges.

Thank you Margaret for showing me pure integrity and amazing work ethics.\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof Robinson/ Margaret\n\nI can't believe that you are retiring. It seems just like yesterday we were all on Skinner Green with your two little girls aged 2 and 4. You have been an inspiration to me and many other MHC students who have crossed your path Majors and Non Majors.  From your outing club stories, and your immense enthusiasm for Mathematics and life in general and it was delight to be in any of your math classes. THANK YOU for all the support you have given me over our 30 years of friendship.  I look forward to seeing you in the Spring during my 30th College Reunion.  In Gratitude and with Much Love - Cristina Ilangakoon Class of 1995 Math Major\n\n\n\n\nThank you so much for supporting me after I graduated from MoHo and gave me suggestions that really helped me to find the direction for my application. Every time talking to you, I learned a lot! Thank you for your contribution to the school and your passion for math has always inspired me!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson- this is Heidi Zhang, class of 2021 who served as your teaching assistant during Covid period when everything was online! I think I didn’t get a chance to take your classes and our most direct interaction is being your TA. However, I always saw you in campus and in Clapp, and my friend Amelia Tran always mentioned you to me! In my memory, you are always patient and encouraging; your smile would melt the South Hadley snow. I think if I didn’t join Mount Holyoke, I probably would not pick math as major. It was the great culture math department has and the lovely professors as you made me interested in diving deeper in this subject. Due to my study aboard second half of my junior year, and covid during my senior year, my on campus live abruptly ended, which is still a great pity and pain. But reading it from a different angle, I feel like this pity will deepen my memory of the priceless math studying and campus life in Mount Holyoke. And I really want to thank you for writing me a lovely card and sending me a MHC hat as thank-you gift after serving as your TA in my senior year. Wish you have an amazing journey after retirement and look forward to seeing you again in the near future!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - congratulations and happy retirement. I was in your Calc and Linear Algebra classes, and really enjoyed them! Your passion for the subject, dedication to us the students, and empathy shone through. I wish you all the best on new adventures and wanted you to know that you made an impact on my life. Thank you so much! \n- Sundus Husain (2008)\n\n\n\n\nProfessor - congratulations on retiring! Thank you so much for being my advisor for four years at MHC. To an 18-year girl, first time studying outside of her native land, you are more than a mentor and a professor, dare to say that, as if I was fortunate enough at that time, to gain a mother-like figure at MHC. Wish you all the best for your future endeavors after retirement. The best is yet to come.\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret, this is Jingyi. I missed you so much! I'll definitely come back for your retirement celebration in the spring. 😭😭😭\n\n\n\n\nProf. Margaret, Congratulations on your retirement! I still remember our office hours and how passionate you were in maths and teaching. You also had so much patience with me and all other students. I feel fortunate to have been one of your students.

Best, Becky Ding Taylor\n\n\n\n\nDear Margaret, as you prepare for your well-deserved retirement, I wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude for the impact you've had on my academic journey and personal growth. Your passion for mathematics was inspiring and contagious. I fondly recall our Abstract Algebra class and the other challenging yet rewarding courses I took with you. Your ability to present complex concepts in an engaging and comprehensible way truly made learning a delightful and satisfying adventure. \nI still remember the quotes you put on our take-home exams, for example, the one that went something like \"after all the effort, we're still confused but about more difficult problems.\" I repeated the same to myself the other week after working on a challenging analysis.\n\nI live in Chicago now. I am a Sr Manager for Product Operations and Strategy at a software company called HubSpot. I love my job and the company. It was another Mount Holyoke alumn who recommended me for the interview ~3 years ago! I got married in July ‘22 and baby Jeremy, our first child, arrived this February. It's been a remarkable and joyful year welcoming him into the world and seeing him grow and change so quickly. Let me know if you’re ever in Chicago or if I can be helpful in any way.\nI wish you all the best in your retirement and your future ventures!\nWith warm regards and gratitude,\nGergana Kostadinova, Class of 2012\n413-221-6291. gerganakh@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations Professor Robinson! I really enjoyed having you as a professor for linear algebra, it was one of my favorite math classes! You taught the class so passionately and were so accommodating as I had my concussion and then we were online for COVID (this was Spring 2020). I wish you a happy retirement and hope you are able to spend more time with your family!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson! \n\nCongratulations on the culmination of an amazing career. Your Linear Algebra class opened my eyes to the beauty of math and the trans-dimensional magic (technical term) of space. Not only did this play a huge role in my thesis work (I am still grateful you agreed to sit on the committee for it), but these concepts have served as valuable building blocks for my creative work in the dance and film sphere.\n\nI hope that you have an amazing retirement and certainly let me know if you find yourself out in the Bay!\n\n\n\n\nDear Mrs. Robinson (though I suppose now that I am closing in on 50 I could call you Margaret!), I have thought of you so many times over the years. Your Calc 1 class back in 1991 (word problems with rabbits!) was a turning point for me, changing my academic trajectory. I initially took the class to complete a distribution requirement, but somewhere along the way Calculus became beautiful, due in no small part to your enthusiasm. After what was a difficult situation vis a vis mathematics at my high school, you rekindled my love for it and allowed me to consider I may actually be \"clever\" in this area, as you once told me. I mention you often when talking to younger people about their academic (and life!) choices--to allow for the possibility that beauty and passion and joy may be found in unexpected places, that seeing something through someone else's eyes, as I saw Calculus through yours, may just change them for the better. There is a student I know, likely headed to MHC next year to study mathematics, and though I am saddened to know she won't benefit from the magic of your classroom, I know that the department you were part of shaping, and the many students you inspired over the years, will continue to honor your legacy, and your influence will be felt for generations. With deepest gratitude and respect, Liz Greason '95\n\n\n\n\nCongratulations! Thank you for making math exciting and fun. I remember the days in your office we chatted about my graduation goals and tennis. Your support and reassurance throughout my journey at MHC meant a lot and I wish you a happy retirement!\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson - Congratulations on your upcoming retirement, and thank you for your wonderful teaching all of these years! I still remember how you taught and challenged us in the differential equations course I took with you 2 decades ago, and how you brought us orange juice and donuts on exam days to help us ace the test. I'll always appreciate how you held us to high standards but also supported us to succeed. These days I'm working as a biostatistician at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, at the intersection of biology, mathematics, and statistics. It's great fun and I could not have gotten here without your help, and the confidence you instilled in me to learn hard things. I wish you all the very best in retirement!! Sincerely, Viviane\n\n\n\n\nWhenever I talk about Mount Holyoke, I always share how amazing and caring the professors are. One story I often tell is about the time you called out my name as I was waiting for the elevator in the Math Building—one year after you had taught me. That moment has stayed with me for years, because my name is not the easiest to remember and pronounce, and it’s a testament to how much you genuinely care about your students. I can’t believe it has been seven years since I first took your class! After you kindly wrote me a recommendation letter, I transferred to the University of Michigan. Although I didn’t continue to major in math, my love for it remains strong. Now, I’m pursuing my master’s degree at UCLA. I rarely check my Mount Holyoke email these days, but today, while trying to subscribe to the California alum newsletter, I logged in and saw the news of your retirement. I knew I had to reach out. I’m sorry I never emailed you after I transferred—I was too shy (and still am, to be honest!). But I want you to know how much of an impact you’ve had on me. Thank you for everything, and I wish you all the best as you embark on this exciting new chapter. -- Best, Fuchun\n\n\n\n\nThank you for being a supportive advisor.  I am thankful that you did not discourage me from participating in the Budapest semester in Mathematics, even though I wasn't the smartest student, it was an amazing experience. Your joy and love of mathematics was infectious. I hope you have many fun plans for retirement! cheers, Anna (Bersagel) Lipinski '00\n\n\n\n\nMargaret was a wonderful mentor to me at Mount Holyoke and was always so supportive and encouraging. Congratulations on your retirement!\n\n\n\n\nEvery memory from your classes remind me of how to be a better teacher for my students. You got us interested and helped us along the way. Congratulations to you; thank you for all that you have done for the MHC community!\n\n\n\n\nDearest Margaret, you have been such an incredible advocate for so many of us, and I know I am truly blessed to have gotten to meet you, and especially because I have been able to stay connected through the years.  You are truly an amazing mathematician, and more importantly an incredible woman that has been a rock for so many of us when we really needed it.  Enjoy your retirement, and rest easy as you have done great works, and deserve to play!  Love Always, Vanessa\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nI recently learned of your upcoming retirement and wanted to take a moment to express my gratitude and best wishes. Your classes during my time at MHC from 2016 to 2019 were among the most rewarding experiences of my academic journey. Serving as your teaching assistant was an honor, and I deeply appreciated the opportunity to learn from your expertise, dedication, and kindness.\n\nOne small thing you did has stayed with me over the years—the idea of keeping a band-aid in your wallet. It was such a simple but thoughtful gesture, and I’ve been doing it ever since. It’s a little reminder of how practical and caring you are.\n\nThank you for all the guidance and support you’ve given over the years. You’ve made such a big difference in the lives of so many students, including mine. I hope you have a happy and relaxing retirement filled with exciting new adventures!\n\nBest,\nLu Yu\n\n\n\n\nMany congratulations dear Margaret! You were instrumental in helping me find my love for Mathematics, and I am so grateful! I started at MHC eager to get through the Math requirements, and one semester with you converted me into a Math major. Your enthusiasm and love for math is contagious, and your kindness is apparent. You deserve a relaxing retirement, but I am sure you will be up to plenty very soon! Lots of love!\n\n\n\n\nYou shaped what it meant to be a part of a math department at a women/marginalized gender-centric college. I appreciate your leadership and we will all miss you!\n\n\n\n\nDear Prof. Robinson, You have inspired so many in our community. I have heard from countless graduates around the world how much they enjoyed your classes and learned from your leadership. On behalf of the Alum Association, we are excited for you to become an \"alum\" of the faculty. Warmly, Trisha\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Robinson,\n\nYou've been more than just an educator – you've been a true inspiration throughout my years at MHC and beyond. Your unique combination of patience and grace in teaching has set a standard I strive to meet in my own career.\n\nThe recommendations you wrote helped open doors for me, but what I carry forward most is the example you set. During my time as a math department chair, I often found myself asking, \"What would Professor Robinson do?\" – especially when students needed extra support and understanding.\n\nWhile Mount Holyoke is losing an extraordinary educator, your impact continues through the countless students you've mentored. I'm deeply grateful that I was one of them. Your infectious spirit, unwavering dedication, and leadership have left an indelible mark on all of us.\n\nMay your retirement bring you all the joy and adventures you so richly deserve!\n\n\n\n\nThank you for all that you have done for me and for others like me. I felt like I could truly learn from you even though I only completed one course with you and it was on zoom my first year at MHC. I always felt like I could ask questions and be wrong on a problem in front of you and I know how important that is for my learning and I try to instill this with my current students. I appreciated how much you genuinely cared for your students and what they did outside of the classroom. I always felt seen by you. Thank you.\n\n\n\n\nYou had such a profound impact on my life as a mentor. Now that I am in a position of supervising others, I try my best to be as supportive of them and their goals as you were of me - and every student who was fortunate enough to be taught by you. I hope you enjoy everything retirement has to offer to its fullest. You've earned it! (Norah Mazel, 2005)\n\n\n\n\nI have very fond memories of MHC and a lot of those have to do with not only the diverse students but also faculty.  One quick story on how Margaret touched my life beyond as my math mentor.  A colleague, fresh out of undergrad starting her career as an electrical engineering, commented on how she appreciated that I showed so much of my bubbly personality during meetings and she left comfortable doing the same.  Until then, I had not thought about how Margaret really made all of our interactions so fun and positive and I approach work with that same energy.  We are currently living in Monterey, CA with our 2 small children and expecting our 3rd this summer.  Thank you for this opportunity to thank Margaret for her mentorship!\n\n\n\n\nProfessor Robinson,\n\nI cannot begin to express my gratitude for all that you did for me during my time studying as a math major at Mount Holyoke! As I think back to the first course that I took with you (I believe it was Linear Algebra in 1993), I remember looking forward to your class and to the occasional visits I made to your office hours that were always extremely helpful! You were so vibrant and engaging that I couldn’t wait to take another one of your classes!! I was blessed to be a part of your mathematical experimentation laboratory class in the Spring of 1994. This was the most dynamic and interactive math class I have ever taken and among the most formative, because it was so different from any other math class offered. The methods I learned in the course, the basic research I conducted, the thoughtful discussion shared in class, and the lengthy reports I wrote to analyze and share my findings all provided invaluable skills, continuous opportunities for critical thinking, and wonderful memories from class! I also gained so much from you and the support you provided during this class – more confidence in my abilities, a greater interest in math research, and an even bigger passion for math than I already had! When I think about the time I spent working on mathematics at Mount Holyoke, this math laboratory course is the first class I think of!\n\nAs my journey toward a mathematics major continued, I applied for your 1995 REU summer research program in p-adic analysis. Although I was not one of the few students selected for this prestigious program, you knew that I genuinely wanted to participate to have the opportunity to experience formal math research. You went above and beyond for me that summer to allow me to be a part of your program! You secured summer room & board for me on campus, provided a space for me in your research group, and amazingly you even found some additional funds for me so that I could receive a small stipend too like the other REU students! I was able to contribute to the group and write up my own findings at the end of this outstanding program. It was one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences I have ever had, and I am forever indebted to you for making this experience possible for me. I know you went out of your way for me that summer, and I will always remember your kindness and your desire to help me learn! Thank you for believing in me!!\n\nOf course, this is just my own college math journey – that of a singular Mount Holyoke math major who graduated almost 30 years ago. I know your legacy is far more expansive than my small experience can illustrate, and I can only imagine how many other students you have touched, inspired, advised, supported, and mentored during your extensive and distinguished career at Mount Holyoke!! We are all blessed to have been your students! I know that Mount Holyoke’s Department of Mathematics will not be the same without you. You have given so much of yourself to your work and to your students over the years, and you will be dearly missed!\n\nBut now it’s time to focus on you, your family, and an exciting new chapter in your life! As you embark on this next journey, I wish you peace, joy, and fulfillment in all the moments that await you!! I am sending my warmest congratulations on your retirement!!\n\nRachel Stavenick Gelderman ‘96\n\nP.S. It has certainly been a pleasure reconnecting with you in the last couple of years as my daughters have attended MHC. As always, I treasure our conversations! I hope we can keep in touch! ❤\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nWhen I heard you were retiring after this semester, it brought back so many golden moments I experienced in the math department—a place that always felt cozy and supportive. I still clearly remember the first time I reached out to you via email for advice on math courses, and at that time, I wasn’t even your advisee. Not only did I get helpful advice, but what impressed me even more was how energetic and thoughtful you were!\n\nI’m a bit introverted and sometimes get nervous talking to people, but your kindness gave me so much confidence and comfort in sharing my thoughts and opening up more. That support carried me through all of college and into life after graduation, including my applications to graduate school.\n\nI’ll always cherish the moments spent in your office—me and my classmates working through problems together, or talking with you about course planning and future goals. Your number theory class remains one of my favorites. Now I work as a quantitative analyst at an asset management firm, where I use math every day—calculus, linear algebra, probability, and more. I’m glad and grateful that the work I do is connected to what I learned in college. I deeply feel that I’m still growing on the foundation built during those years.\n\nThank you again for your warmth, generosity, and support over the years. I feel truly lucky to have been one of your students.\n\nWishing you all the best in your new adventures! \n\nWarmly,\nMiao Zhang\n\n\n\n\nHi Margaret,\n\nHappy retirement!\n\nI used to dream of the day I’d return to campus as a successful alum, sharing how my time at Mount Holyoke changed my life and career. Of course, I’m not here today as someone who can donate millions of dollars—I just finished my master’s in Data Science at NYU last week and will soon be moving to D.C. to begin my career as a Machine Learning Engineer. And of course, I once thought you might be at Mount Holyoke forever, never retiring. But even now, I carry with me the lessons you taught me—lessons that will stay with me for a lifetime.\n\nI first met you during COVID, and from that moment on, you became one of my greatest supports—both academically and personally. You comforted me when I had to take Abstract Algebra at 5 a.m. from the West Coast. You guided my course selections and encouraged me to take a gap year when I needed it most. You wrote recommendation letters that opened the doors to research programs and graduate school. And even after I graduated, you continued to check in on how I was doing at NYU—proof that mentorship, at its best, never truly ends.\n\nSo while I may still be at the beginning of my journey, here are some things I already know:\n\nI’ve learned to maintain a healthy and positive mind.\n\nI’ve learned to explore and construct my identity with patience and kindness.\n\nI’ve learned to stay sharp in abstract thinking and soft in heart to care for others.\n\nI’ve learned to think independently while staying connected to people and the world around me.\n\nI’ve learned that love and mentorship often means supporting someone—even when their decision is to leave math.\n\nAnd I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of mathematics—even though it won’t be my career. (But much to my surprise, as an MLE, I am—and will be—using math every day!)\n\nMy Mount Holyoke education—especially under your guidance—was transformative. It shaped not only my intellect but also my values and sense of self. I know these words can’t fully express my gratitude, but I will always look back on this chapter with clarity and pride, knowing: this is where it all began.\n\nI know you won’t forget what happened here at Mount Holyoke, and I wish you the very best in this next chapter of life. You’ve made a lasting impact on so many of us—including me.\n\nWith deep appreciation,\nJingyi Wu\n\n\n\n\nDear Professor Margaret, \n\nI will always remember your enthusiasm for teaching and your patience and kindness. You were truly a bright presence on campus and obviously you have so much to be proud of. I think all of us students of yours fondly think upon you and admire you so much, at least I do. Thank you for your dedication, all that you are and do is amazing! I hope you will have a lovely and relaxing retirement and get to spend time with your family and friends and do everything that you set your wishes to. It was always the best to have pizza during Math talks and also visit you in your office hours.  \n\nSincerely,\nEsther XX"
