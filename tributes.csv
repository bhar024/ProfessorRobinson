You were an inspiration. You made me feel like a math minor was possible, even with a ""double major"" like astronomy and physics. (I also had a French Minor!) I have memories of your office, chatting like adults. I'm so grateful to you. Especially because the reason I likely got into MHC was a heartfelt recommendation from Ellen Ortyl, who had worked on campus. She had connected me with Laurie Kamins, whose lovely kids I had the pleasure of babysitting for!

I still remember your classes vividly. Beyond the equations and proofs, you taught me how to approach problems with curiosity and persistence—skills that continue to serve me well in my personal and professional life. Your passion for mathematics and your ability to make complex concepts engaging left a lasting impression on me, and I’m so grateful to have been one of your students. Every time I've had the chance to come back on campus, I make sure to stop by your office on the 4th floor. You've taught and inspired generations of students, and I'm proud to be one of them.

I miss you so much and wanted to share a quick update about my life. 
After graduating from Isenberg in 2016, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye as I was expecting my first child in May.  In the Fall of 2018, I started teaching at Santa Clara University's Finance department, where I spent four years before joining Meta as a data scientist.  My role involves developing new methodologies to measure top advertisers.  

I'm grateful for your guidance and support throughout my journey.  Without you, I wouldn't be where I am today.  You played a significant role not only as my professor, but also as a mentor and guardian to help guide my paths forward.  I feel so lucky to have been one of your students and advisees.  

Sending you love from the sunny Bay Area!  Please visit us whenever you can. Thank you immensely for everything!  Your impact on my life is immeasurable.

Thank you for everything you have done for me. I am so lucky to have had you for Calc 1 in the fall of 2020. Although I never completed another course with you, you were always there to help me through my other math courses. Even though you had so many other students that you were teaching and had taught prior to teaching me, you still remembered details about me and the details I had shared about my sisters. I loved having you as a professor and as a mentor as I pushed my way through the decision to become a math minor instead of a math major.

Your Calc 1 class back in 1991 (word problems with rabbits!) was a turning point for me, changing my academic trajectory. I initially took the class to complete a distribution requirement, but somewhere along the way Calculus became beautiful, due in no small part to your enthusiasm. After what was a difficult situation vis a vis mathematics at my high school, you rekindled my love for it and allowed me to consider I may actually be ""clever"" in this area, as you once told me. I mention you often when talking to younger people about their academic (and life!) choices--to allow for the possibility that beauty and passion and joy may be found in unexpected places, that seeing something through someone else's eyes, as I saw Calculus through yours, may just change them for the better.

I cannot begin to express my gratitude for all that you did for me during my time studying as a math major at Mount Holyoke! As I think back to the first course that I took with you (I believe it was Linear Algebra in 1993), I remember looking forward to your class and to the occasional visits I made to your office hours that were always extremely helpful! You were so vibrant and engaging that I couldn’t wait to take another one of your classes!! I was blessed to be a part of your mathematical experimentation laboratory class in the Spring of 1994. This was the most dynamic and interactive math class I have ever taken and among the most formative, because it was so different from any other math class offered. The methods I learned in the course, the basic research I conducted, the thoughtful discussion shared in class, and the lengthy reports I wrote to analyze and share my findings all provided invaluable skills, continuous opportunities for critical thinking, and wonderful memories from class! I also gained so much from you and the support you provided during this class – more confidence in my abilities, a greater interest in math research, and an even bigger passion for math than I already had! When I think about the time I spent working on mathematics at Mount Holyoke, this math laboratory course is the first class I think of!

As my journey toward a mathematics major continued, I applied for your 1995 REU summer research program in p-adic analysis. Although I was not one of the few students selected for this prestigious program, you knew that I genuinely wanted to participate to have the opportunity to experience formal math research. You went above and beyond for me that summer to allow me to be a part of your program! You secured summer room & board for me on campus, provided a space for me in your research group, and amazingly you even found some additional funds for me so that I could receive a small stipend too like the other REU students! I was able to contribute to the group and write up my own findings at the end of this outstanding program. It was one of the most challenging yet most rewarding experiences I have ever had, and I am forever indebted to you for making this experience possible for me. I know you went out of your way for me that summer, and I will always remember your kindness and your desire to help me learn! Thank you for believing in me!!

Of course, this is just my own college math journey – that of a singular Mount Holyoke math major who graduated almost 30 years ago. I know your legacy is far more expansive than my small experience can illustrate, and I can only imagine how many other students you have touched, inspired, advised, supported, and mentored during your extensive and distinguished career at Mount Holyoke!! We are all blessed to have been your students! I know that Mount Holyoke’s Department of Mathematics will not be the same without you. You have given so much of yourself to your work and to your students over the years, and you will be dearly missed!

But now it’s time to focus on you, your family, and an exciting new chapter in your life! As you embark on this next journey, I wish you peace, joy, and fulfillment in all the moments that await you!! I am sending my warmest congratulations on your retirement!!

Happy retirement!

When I heard you were retiring after this semester, it brought back so many golden moments I experienced in the math department—a place that always felt cozy and supportive. I still clearly remember the first time I reached out to you via email for advice on math courses, and at that time, I wasn’t even your advisee. Not only did I get helpful advice, but what impressed me even more was how energetic and thoughtful you were!

I’m a bit introverted and sometimes get nervous talking to people, but your kindness gave me so much confidence and comfort in sharing my thoughts and opening up more. That support carried me through all of college and into life after graduation, including my applications to graduate school.

I’ll always cherish the moments spent in your office—me and my classmates working through problems together, or talking with you about course planning and future goals. Your number theory class remains one of my favorites. Now I work as a quantitative analyst at an asset management firm, where I use math every day—calculus, linear algebra, probability, and more. I’m glad and grateful that the work I do is connected to what I learned in college. I deeply feel that I’m still growing on the foundation built during those years.

Thank you again for your warmth, generosity, and support over the years. I feel truly lucky to have been one of your students.

Happy retirement!

I used to dream of the day I’d return to campus as a successful alum, sharing how my time at Mount Holyoke changed my life and career. Of course, I’m not here today as someone who can donate millions of dollars—I just finished my master’s in Data Science at NYU last week and will soon be moving to D.C. to begin my career as a Machine Learning Engineer. And of course, I once thought you might be at Mount Holyoke forever, never retiring. But even now, I carry with me the lessons you taught me—lessons that will stay with me for a lifetime.

I first met you during COVID, and from that moment on, you became one of my greatest supports—both academically and personally. You comforted me when I had to take Abstract Algebra at 5 a.m. from the West Coast. You guided my course selections and encouraged me to take a gap year when I needed it most. You wrote recommendation letters that opened the doors to research programs and graduate school. And even after I graduated, you continued to check in on how I was doing at NYU—proof that mentorship, at its best, never truly ends.

So while I may still be at the beginning of my journey, here are some things I already know:

I’ve learned to maintain a healthy and positive mind.

I’ve learned to explore and construct my identity with patience and kindness.

I’ve learned to stay sharp in abstract thinking and soft in heart to care for others.

I’ve learned to think independently while staying connected to people and the world around me.

I’ve learned that love and mentorship often means supporting someone—even when their decision is to leave math.

And I’ve learned to appreciate the beauty of mathematics—even though it won’t be my career. (But much to my surprise, as an MLE, I am—and will be—using math every day!)

My Mount Holyoke education—especially under your guidance—was transformative. It shaped not only my intellect but also my values and sense of self. I know these words can’t fully express my gratitude, but I will always look back on this chapter with clarity and pride, knowing: this is where it all began.

I know you won’t forget what happened here at Mount Holyoke, and I wish you the very best in this next chapter of life. You’ve made a lasting impact on so many of us—including me.

I will always remember your enthusiasm for teaching and your patience and kindness. You were truly a bright presence on campus and obviously you have so much to be proud of. I think all of us students of yours fondly think upon you and admire you so much, at least I do. Thank you for your dedication, all that you are and do is amazing! I hope you will have a lovely and relaxing retirement and get to spend time with your family and friends and do everything that you set your wishes to. It was always the best to have pizza during Math talks and also visit you in your office hours.  

Sincerely,
Esther XX",I would like to receive emails about the Spring celebration for her.
